Agriplus is a website farmers are able to showcase their produce online and have their produce in the market and has clients order them.This platform simplifies the customers work and connect farmers and agricultural business people to their market.Having an online platform saves customers time and energy as they are able to get qua lity food products at ease at their doorsteps and also farmers are able to have their produce sold at an affordable price and they get their income ontime which help them in their daily lives.
While creating this website i thought of myslef as a farmer and i wanted to make an impact on their lives by creating a website which was easy for them to connect with customers and do their business at a space which would bring a collaboration mindset to both the farmers and customers. 
Some challenges I faced while creating the wbesite was the diversity of the website page and how it work make easier for both farmers and business people and how it would be easier for them to use the website.
